I drew a system that has 3 pins, on at A connecting the linear actuator to the ground. Next, connecting the actuator bar to the lever bar. Lastyly, pinning the lever bar to the ground. I used the integrated servo actuator which has an extension length of 50cm and max of 36 kN of force.
Using an height of 30 cm which can be calucated using geometry, we can find the angle phi by inverse tan. Once phi is solved then theta can be solved for considering sum of angles. Then L can be solved for using height/sin theta. Finally we can find By using moment around C which is 60kN which translates to max weight the system can raise to max height of 30 cm.
